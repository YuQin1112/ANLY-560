### LAB 1

SQL code `lab1.sql`, snapshot of query result table `lab1.csv` and `lab1.png`.

#### code explanation

I use `select` to indicate what data column I want to select from the schema, and then use `from` and `inner join` to find intersection of the three table (`film`, `film_category` and `category`) that eventually lists out all the films with relation to its categoty.
